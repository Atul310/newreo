undefined is  we dont put value to it 
like for eg 

let  state;
it is we only use variable but value is not defined ==>> undefined  value
===============================================================================


null DataType ==>>

representation of empty value 



let state = null

About Implicti and explicit
===============================
In programming, implicit and explicit refer to how instructions or actions are specified within code.

Here's a breakdown of the concepts:

Implicit:

    Meaning: Something that happens automatically without the programmer's direct instruction.
    Examples:
        Type coercion: Converting a value from one data type to another without explicit casting (e.g., adding a string and a number in JavaScript results in concatenation).
        Default function arguments: Values assigned to function parameters if not provided explicitly when calling the function.
        Implicit casting: Automatic conversion of data types in certain operations (e.g., assigning a floating-point value to an integer variable in some languages).
        Implicit constructors: Default mechanisms for creating objects without using a new keyword (e.g., in Python).

Explicit:

    Meaning: Something that is directly and clearly stated by the programmer, leaving no room for interpretation.
    Examples:
        Variable declarations: Using keywords like let or var to specify the data type of a variable.
        Function calls: Providing arguments in the correct order when calling a function.
        Type casting: Converting a value from one data type to another using explicit functions or keywords (e.g., parseInt() in JavaScript).
        Control flow statements: Using if, else, for, while, etc., to explicitly control the program's execution flow.
        Error handling: Using try-catch blocks to proactively handle potential errors.

Key Points:

    Implicit features can make code concise but can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior if not fully understood.
    Explicit code is generally more readable, maintainable, and less prone to unintended consequences.
    It's often a balance between using implicit features for convenience and explicitness for clarity and control.
    Best practices often encourage more explicit code to enhance readability and prevent subtle errors.

Additional Considerations:

    Context-specific: The exact implications of implicit and explicit can vary depending on the programming language and environment.
    Readability: Explicit code is often easier for other developers to understand and maintain.
    Debugging: Implicit behaviors can make debugging more challenging, as the cause of unexpected results might be less obvious.
    Performance: Implicit operations can sometimes be more efficient, but explicit code can provide more control over performance optimization.
