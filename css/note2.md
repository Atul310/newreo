"use strict";
se strict"; is a directive in JavaScript that enables strict mode, enforcing stricter coding practices and catching potential errors early on.

Here's a breakdown of its key features:

1. Activation:

    Globally: Add "use strict"; as the first statement in your script.
    Within a Function: Place it as the first statement inside a function.

2. Benefits:

    Error Prevention:
        Catches common mistakes like undeclared variables, duplicate parameter names, assigning to non-writable properties, etc.
        Improves code quality and reliability.
    Stricter Syntax:
        Enforces correct usage of this within functions.
        Disallows certain confusing syntax patterns.
    Future Compatibility:
        Prepares code for potential JavaScript language changes.

3. Specific Rules:

    No Implicit Global Variables: Undeclared variables within strict mode code throw errors.
    No Deleting Variables or Functions: Prevents accidental deletions.
    No Octal Literals: Disallows ambiguous octal numbers (0755).
    Stricter this Binding: this in functions is not bound to the global object by default.
    Stricter Function Parameter Handling: No duplicate parameter names or shadowing of variables in outer scopes.
    Stricter eval() Behavior: Prevents eval() from introducing variables into the outer scope.

4. Good Practice:

    While not mandatory, using strict mode is highly recommended for cleaner, more predictable, and future-proof JavaScript code.
    Especially beneficial for larger projects and collaborative development.
