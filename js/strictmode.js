ECMAScript 5 and later let scripts opt in to a

to understand what's going on when there are problems.

The normal, non-strict mode of JavaScript is sometimes referred 
to as sloppy mode. This isn't an official designation, 
but you are likely to come across it if you spend time doing 
serious JavaScript code.

    enforces a stricter set of rules during the code execution.

To enable strict mode, you can add the following line at the 
beginning of a script or a function:
