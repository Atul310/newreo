/*     Reverse a String:
        Write a function to reverse a given string.

    Palindrome Check:
        Determine if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backward).

    Anagram Check:
        Write a function to check if two strings are anagrams of each other.

    String Length:
        Find the length of a string without using the built-in length property or method.

    String Concatenation:
        Implement string concatenation without using the + operator.

    String Truncation:
        Write a function to truncate a string to a specified length and add ellipsis ("...") if necessary.

    Substring Search:
        Implement a function to check if a substring exists in a given string.

    String Reversal (Word-wise):
        Reverse the order of words in a given string.

    Count Characters:
        Count the occurrences of each character in a string.

    Remove Duplicates:
        Remove duplicate characters from a string.

    Capitalize Words:
        Write a function to capitalize the first letter of each word in a sentence.

    CamelCase to Sentence:
        Convert a CamelCase string to a sentence (e.g., "helloWorld" to "Hello World").

    String Rotation:
        Check if one string is a rotation of another (e.g., "waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat").

    String Compression:
        Implement a basic string compression algorithm. For example, "aabcccccaaa" becomes "a2b1c5a3".

    Substring Removal:
        Write a function to remove a specified substring from a given string.

    String Interpolation:
        Implement a simple string interpolation function that replaces placeholders with values.

    Caesar Cipher:
        Implement a Caesar cipher for encrypting and decrypting strings.

    Longest Common Prefix:
        Find the longest common prefix among an array of strings.

    String to Integer (atoi):
        Implement the atoi function, converting a string to an integer.

    Valid Parentheses:
        Check if a given string of parentheses is valid.

These questions cover a variety of string manipulation techniques and will help you become more proficient with JavaScript strings. Happy coding!
